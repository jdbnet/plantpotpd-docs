You can put cuffed peds into jail at the blue station markers around the map.

These only appear when an arrested ped is either in the current vehicle or is
being controlled by a player.

### Controls

```O``` - Set waypoint to the closest jail drop off point (when there is an arrested ped in the current vehicle or is being controlled by a player)

```U``` - Place ped in jail (must be nearby an arrested ped at a jail drop off point)
